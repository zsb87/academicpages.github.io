  abstract={This paper takes the high voltage power system dynamic reactive power compensation at the conditions of the mine load smooth changes, studies the negative effects inhibition of the HVC contactor switched capacitors reactive power compensation device in ambient temperature perturbation. The basic principles and structure of intelligent reactive power compensation device based on contactor zero-crossing switching control and the response time compensation method for different ambient temperature and operating voltage are proposed, and the expert decision-making switched control strategy is given. The research can effectively eliminate the adverse effects of capacitor inrush current and voltage flicker in the moment of switching, and ensure safe and stable operation of the grid under conditions that satisfy the system reactive power compensation.},
