  abstract={Wearable health-monitoring systems must achieve a balance between the often opposing goals of hardware overhead and classification accuracy. Prior works have presented various approaches to dynamically scale the accuracy of these systems as a function of available resources. In this paper, we present a framework which retroactively improves the accuracy of prior estimates when resources become available, using a novel global cost minimization function. We benchmark our algorithm on an audio-based nutrition monitoring dataset. Results confirm the efficacy of our technique.},
