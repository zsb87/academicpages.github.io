## Start your own blog

Clone this repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:bernardopacheco/bernardopacheco.github.io.git
```

Install the dependencies:

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)

Run the commands:

```
$ npm install
$ jekyll build
$ grunt
$ jekyll serve
```

Done. Now you can go in your browser and access the site locally in http://0.0.0.0:4000.

To customize the blog with your own information, just update two files: [_config.yml](https://github.com/bernardopacheco/bernardopacheco.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml) and [src/css/variables.less](https://github.com/bernardopacheco/bernardopacheco.github.io/blob/master/src/css/variables.less).

The properties are self-explanatory. With these informations the site structure is generated, including file names, share options, number of posts per page, GitHub links, repository status, Disqus widgets, font size, font family and the color palette.

Enjoy!
