# About

My name is **Shibo Zhang**. I'm a computer science PhD at Northwestern University. I am a big fan of **machine learning**, in both machine learning theory and applications. 


My research area is **mobile health**. I am interested in applying machine learning and data analysis techniques to help advance our ability to understand, detect, predict, and ultimately prevent problematic health habits.
