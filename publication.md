[I sense overeating: Motif-based machine learning framework to detect overeating using wrist-worn sensing][1]. 
S. Zhang, W. Stogin, and N. Alshurafa. *Information Fusion, Volume 41, May 2018.*
<!-- Authors face the important issue to detect people's overeating activity, which often causes health issues, by using wrist-worn sensors. Specifically, a machine learning framework was designed to detect and accurately count the number of feeding gestures during an eating episode to characterize each eating episode with a feeding gesture count using a 6-axis inertial wrist-worn sensor. Results show optimal result for participant-dependent models. Generalization relies on a motif-based time-point fusion classification framework. Finally, mapping feeding gesture count to caloric intake, allowed to roughly estimate whether participants overate while watching television. -->

<!-- In this paper we use a wrist-worn sensor to test a generalized machine learning models' reliability in detecting eating episodes through data processing. We process data from a 6-axis inertial sensor. Since most eating episodes do not occur while moving, we filter out periods of physical activity, and then use an advanced motif-based time-point fusion technique to detect feeding gestures. We also cluster each of the false alarms into four categories in an effort to identify the main behaviors that confound feeding gesture detection. This result shows clear challenges in characterizing eating episodes by using a single inertial-based wrist-worn sensor. -->
