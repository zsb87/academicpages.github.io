In this paper we use a wrist-worn sensor to test a generalized machine learning models' reliability in detecting eating episodes through data processing. We process data from a 6-axis inertial sensor. Since most eating episodes do not occur while moving, we filter out periods of physical activity, and then use an advanced motif-based time-point fusion technique to detect feeding gestures. We also cluster each of the false alarms into four categories in an effort to identify the main behaviors that confound feeding gesture detection. This result shows clear challenges in characterizing eating episodes by using a single inertial-based wrist-worn sensor.
