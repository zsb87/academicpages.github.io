ABSTRACT="This paper presents an approach for estimating caloric intake given a
limited number of foods provided to patients in-bed. Data collected from a
proximity sensor, inertial measurement unit, ambient light, and audio
sensor placed around the neck are used to classify food-type consumed by
second using a random forest classifier (n=100 trees). A multiple linear
regression model is then developed for each food-type to map second-level
features to calories per second (CPS). To evaluate our system, we conducted
a user study in a patient simulated lab setting, where 10 participants were
asked to eat while sitting on a patient bed. A Mandometer is used to
determine start/end of eating, and to determine the caloric value of each
bite. A user-independent analysis demonstrated food-type detection at
97.2\% F1-score, and a 4.05 kCal RMSE estimation per food-type on average.
Our system shows promise in distinguishing food items and predicting
calorie intake in a bed-ridden setting given a limited set of food items."
